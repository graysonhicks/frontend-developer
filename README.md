# Gridium Dashboard

## Description

This challenge was a ton of fun, thank you for the opportunity! The page was built mainly with React, webpack, React Router, and Charts.js. I have had a React 'Admin Dashboard' on my todo list for a while, so I used that basic idea to display the data of a Gridium developer.

It consumes the data that was provided, does some parsing at the app level, and some more category specific at the component level. React Router handles all of the category switches. The webpack bundle was gzipped and hosted on AWS S3. The site is also moderately :) responsive so check it out on mobile.

Thank you again. Hope you enjoy!
